<p>This is the About app page for the Hydrate App, an entry for the ROBOHackIT 2022, which is organized by the Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax, Virginia, USA. </p>

<p>The goal of this submission was to create a Web App that could help someone understand how much fluids they should be consuming on a daily basis to be properly hydrated. The graph at the top of the screen gives the user a view of their hydration status throughout the day. The window for watching the hydration level is from 7am to 9pm. They can add various drinks and meals with the form buttons, and remove them by clicking on the items in the list. </p>

<p>The hydration calculation is the default for a man. The hydration values for the meals and drinks are not the real values, but numbers that made the code easier to write.</p>

<p>This Web App is one of the first times I've used HTML/CSS/Javascript to code. My background has been only in python, so it was a bit difficult to pick up a new language for the Hackathon, but it was nice to see the results appear on a webpage.</p>

<p>The information regarding hydration was taken from the following website:
	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207053
</p>

<p>The coding I learned was in the book:
	Beginners Guide to Building Mobile Web Apps by Eva Holland and Chris Minnick
